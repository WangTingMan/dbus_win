# dbus release checklist

To make a release of D-Bus, do the following:

 - check out a fresh copy from Git

 - verify that the libtool versioning/library soname is
   changed if it needs to be, or not changed if not
    - remember to update **both** `configure.ac` **and** `meson.build`
    - CMake takes the version number from `configure.ac` and so should not
      need updating

 - update the file NEWS based on the git history

 - verify that the version number of dbus-specification.xml is
   changed if it needs to be; if changes have been made, update the
   release date in that file

 - update the AUTHORS file with "make update-authors" if necessary

 - the version number should have major.minor.micro, even
   if micro is 0, i.e. "1.0.0" and "1.2.0" not "1.0"/"1.2"; the micro
   version should be even for releases, and odd for intermediate snapshots
    - remember to update **both** `configure.ac` **and** `meson.build`
    - CMake takes the version number from `configure.ac` and so should not
      need updating

 - "make distcheck" (DO NOT just "make dist" - pass the check!)

 - if make distcheck fails, fix it.

 - once distcheck succeeds, "git commit -a".  This is the version
   of the tree that corresponds exactly to the released tarball.

 - tag the tree with "git tag -s -m 'Released X.Y.Z' dbus-X.Y.Z"
   where X.Y.Z is the version of the release.  If you can't sign
   then simply created an unsigned annotated tag:
   "git tag -a -m 'Released X.Y.Z' dbus-X.Y.Z".

 - bump the version number up in `configure.ac` and `meson.build`
   again (so the micro version is odd),
   and commit it.  Make sure you do this *after* tagging the previous
   release! The idea is that git has a newer version number
   than anything released. Similarly, bump the version number of
   dbus-specification.xml and set the release date to "(not finalized)".

 - merge the branch you've released to the chronologically-later
   branch (usually "master"). You'll probably have to fix a merge
   conflict in configure.ac (the version number).

 - push your changes and the tag to the central repository with
     git push origin master dbus-X.Y dbus-X.Y.Z

 - scp your tarball to freedesktop.org server and copy it to
   dbus.freedesktop.org:/srv/dbus.freedesktop.org/www/releases/dbus/dbus-X.Y.Z.tar.xz.
   This should be possible if you're in group "dbus"

 - Update the online documentation with `make -C doc maintainer-upload-docs`.

 - update the wiki page http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/dbus by
   adding the new release under the Download heading. Then, cut the
   link and changelog for the previous that was there.

 - post to dbus@lists.freedesktop.org announcing the release.

## Making a ".0" stable release

We create a branch for each stable release. The branch name should be
dbus-X.Y which is a branch that has releases versioned X.Y.Z;
changes on a stable branch should be limited to significant bug fixes.

Because we won't make minor changes like keeping up with the latest
deprecations on a stable branch, stable branches should turn off the
gcc warning for deprecated declarations (e.g. see commit 4ebb275ab7).

Be extra-careful not to merge master (or any branch based on master) into a
stable branch.

To branch:

    git branch dbus-X.Y

and upload the branch tag to the server:

    git push origin dbus-X.Y

To develop in this branch:

    git checkout dbus-X.Y
